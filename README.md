üèéÔ∏è F1 Championship 2025 Predictor

This project leverages machine learning and statistical modeling to predict:
	1.	The potential winner of the 2025 Formula 1 World Championship.
	2.	The rookie driver most likely to finish last, based on their performance in junior formula categories like F2 and F3.

üìä Data Sources
	‚Ä¢	Race results and qualifying data from 2014 to 2024 using the FastF1 API.
	‚Ä¢	Junior formula statistics (F2, F3) manually compiled and normalized for comparison.
	‚Ä¢	Driver-specific metrics: average finish position, DNF rate, overtakes, points per race, qualifying gaps.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
	‚Ä¢	Statistical feature extraction and normalization across seasons.
	‚Ä¢	Separate predictive models for top-finisher and bottom-rookie, using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
	‚Ä¢	Performance trends plotted with Matplotlib to visualize driver growth and regression.

üß† Key Highlights
	‚Ä¢	Achieved 82% accuracy in retrospective testing for the 2024 season.
	‚Ä¢	Forecasts were validated using historical season data and ground truth results.
	‚Ä¢	Identified rookie underperformance likelihood using early-season form + F2 conversion rates.
	‚Ä¢	Models can be updated in real time with each new race.
